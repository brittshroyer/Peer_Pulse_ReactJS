###About
You are planning a day/night out with a person/group of people and the question arises: "What do you want to do?" And the dreaded response "I dunno, what to you want to do?" arises.

PeerPulse is a solution to that problematic question!
A member of the group creates a question and then shares it with others to get feedback by having others vote for their favorite option.
